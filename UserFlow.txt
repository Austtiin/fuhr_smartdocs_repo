s how the interactive UI and backend would work to achieve your desired experience:

User Uploads Receipt:

The user interacts with your Azure Static Web App UI.

They select a receipt image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, PDF).

The UI directly uploads this file to a designated "pending" container in Azure Blob Storage.

UI Behavior: Immediately after upload, the UI displays a loading circle next to the uploaded file, indicating that processing has begun.

Trigger Azure Function:

The new file upload event in Azure Blob Storage automatically triggers an Azure Function (specifically, a Blob Trigger function).

Process with Document Intelligence:

The Azure Function retrieves the uploaded image.

It then calls the Azure AI Document Intelligence (Receipt Model) API to perform OCR and extract structured data from the receipt.

Store Processed Data:

Once Document Intelligence returns the extracted JSON data, the Azure Function processes it.

It stores this structured receipt data (e.g., merchant, total, date, line items, and a link to the original image in Blob Storage) into Azure Cosmos DB (or your chosen database). It also updates the status of the file.

Update UI (Real-time or Polling):

Option A (Real-time with Azure SignalR Service): For a truly interactive experience, the Azure Function can send a message to Azure SignalR Service when a receipt is successfully processed. Your UI, connected to SignalR, receives this message and updates instantly.

Option B (Polling): The UI periodically polls a lightweight API endpoint (another Azure Function or a simple Web App endpoint) to check the status of uploaded files.

UI Behavior: Once the processing is complete and the status is updated, the UI automatically moves the receipt entry from the "loading" state to a "completed files" section or breadcrumb, displaying the extracted key information.

Viewing Completed Files:

The "completed files" breadcrumb/section in your UI will fetch data directly from Azure Cosmos DB to display the processed receipt details. Users can click on a processed receipt to view its extracted data and potentially the original image.
